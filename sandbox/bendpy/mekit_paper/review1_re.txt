RESPONSE TO REVIEW #1

We would like to thank the reviewer for useful comments. They have been
addressed in the revised text together with the comments from the second
reviewer. Changes suggested by the first reviewer are highlighted in the 
marked text by the red color and commented on briefly in the text below. 
Apart from the modifications proposed by the reviewers we have also fixed 
several typos and changed wording in a few places to improve readability 
of the text. Finally the incorrect strong formulation at the beginning of
Section 3 has been removed.

1. Rewrite the introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have rewritten the introduction such that most symbols are now explained
prior to being used in the equation (1).

2. Wrong definition on the form b. Needs $b_r$
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have rewritten the introduction such that most symbols are now explained
The definition (now on top of page 4) has been fixed.

3. Growth of the condition number of the saddle point system due to
discretization: "..., however the condition number of linear systems arising 
from partial differential equation depend on the basis used.'''
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We agree with the reviewer that the choice of basis has an effect on the growth of
the condition number. This is illustrated in our results where in Figure 2 the
condition number for the system discretized with polynomials of degree 25 is
10^15 while system of the same size due to eigenfunctions has the condition
number 10^5. Moreover there is a sentence in the Section 4 which states that 
''This growth is due to the saddle point nature of the continuous problem 
(3) but it can be greatly accelerated by the choice of the discretization.'' We
believe this statement is correct and does not contradict the statement of the
reviewer.

4. Preconditioner in relation to continuous inf-sup condition
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We now mention that the negative power of the eigenvalue matrix used to
construct the N matrix for the Schur complement suggests that the multiplier
should be sought in Sobolev spaces with negative indices.

5. Inconsistent style in the references
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The citation style is now consistent.
