		==========LE(gendre)-GA(lerkin)==========
LEGA sounds almost like LEGO, doesn't it? And that is the idea of this package.

LEGA is a collection of building blocks(matrices) for implementing solvers of
partial differential equations based on their variational formulation and
Galerkin method using Legendre polynomials(or their linear combinations) as
basis functions of the descrete function spaces.
